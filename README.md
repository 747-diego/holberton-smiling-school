<h1> Implement a design from scratch </h1>
<p> Hello! Thanks for diving in this far! 
<br> In this project, I will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I have learned previously. </p>

<h3> What's Stored in here ? </h3>
<p> In this project, you will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file. </p>
